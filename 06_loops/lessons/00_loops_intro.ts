            "At this point you've covered data types, variables, functions, and conditionals. There's only one more thing you need to learn to be considered a competent, beginner programmer: **loops**. Loops let you repeat actions without writing the same code multiple times.\n\nRemember programming the turtle to draw a triangle? You wrote `forward(100)` and `right(120)` three separate times. For a triangle this gets repetitive, but imagine how annoying it would be if you wanted to draw a shape with 100 sides. That's where loops come in.\n\nLoops are powerful because they let you tell the computer to repeat actions without having to write the same code multiple times. They turn you from someone who types instructions into someone who describes patterns.",

The key parts are:\n- `for i in range(4):` tells Python to repeat the code "within" the loop 4 times\n- Just like with functions, indentation shows what\'s "inside" the loop\n\nTake a little time to compare the two different representations.
