You've discovered single loops, nested loops for circular patterns, and nested loops with positioning for grids. These powerful concepts build on everything you've learned so far: variables, f-strings, functions, and conditionals.\n\nThis review uses **interleaving** to mix questions about loops with questions about earlier topics. By switching between concepts, your brain has to actively recall what you've learned rather than following a single pattern. This creates stronger, more durable learning. Take your time with each question and remember: the struggle is where the learning happens!",
