This ability to \"reset\" a variable means that variables can track values as they change throughout a program's execution.\n\nVariables are called variables because they have the ability to change over the course of the program. As you work through the following lessons, imagine new values going in and out of the slot provided by the variable.",

What's really interesting, however, is that if you do things carefully, you can read the value of a variable and then use that value to when resetting the variable.\n\nThe problem below illustrates this read and reset pattern. On the first line, the value of `x` is set to `10`. On the second line, the value of `x` is read and then this original value of `x` is used to calculate the new value of `x`.
