Every time it sees a line with a `=`, it calculates the value of the stuff on the right and stores it into the variable on the left. Every time a variable is read, the computer accesses its memory for the value stored inside it. If a variable by that name hasn\'t been created before, then the computer "raises" a `NameError`. If the operation between the data isn\'t possible, then it "raises" a `TypeError`. Finally, if there\'s something like a missing parentheses or quotation mark, it "raises" a `SyntaxError`.\n\nThis is basically how your computer is working right now. It\'s executing billions of lines of code a second, reading values in memory and using those values to calculate new things. The overall effect is a machine that seamlessly responds to your clicks and keystrokes.',
