Often in programming, however, you want to do something when a particular condition is not True. For example, think about a password checker. When the password is wrong, you don't want silence - you want a clear message saying 'Access denied!'. That's where `else` comes in. With `if`/`else`, your function ALWAYS does exactly one of two things. Learning to use the `else` properly gives you more control to match your programs to the situation.",
