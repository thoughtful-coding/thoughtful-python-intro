Therefore, understanding the _type of data_ you're operating on is very important. The first **data type** we're going to cover are **strings**. Strings are sequences of characters that can form words, sentences, and paragraphs. They are composed of letters, spaces, punctuation, and even numerical characters.\n\nStrings are most often denoted by being inside double quotes. This means they start with a `\"` and end with a `\"`. Based on this definition, select the **two** options below that are valid strings.",
