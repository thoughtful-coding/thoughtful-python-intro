That's great, but as your programs get more complex, you'll need to break them up into understandable chunks. That's where **functions** come in!\n\nThink of functions like teaching someone a new skill. Once they learn the skill, you can just say "do that thing we practiced" instead of explaining it all over again. Functions let you:\n - **Reuse code** without copying and pasting\n- **Organize** your programs into logical chunks\n- **Avoid mistakes** by writing tricky code just once`,
