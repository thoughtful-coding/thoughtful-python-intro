The `print()` function's job is to display the inputs given on the computer screen. \"Inside\" the `print()` function there's a lot of code, including calls to sub-functions that in turn call their own sub-sub-functions. In practice, a single call to `print()` is an incredible cascade; layers upon layers of functions are used to interact with the deepest parts of the computer to change all the right pixels on your monitor.",
