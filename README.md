# Thoughtful Python

An introductory Python course designed for the [Thoughtful Coding](https://thoughtful-coding.github.io) platform.

## About

This course teaches Python fundamentals through interactive, browser-based lessons. Students learn by working through structured exercises with immediate feedback, no installation required.

## Course Structure

The course covers:
- Data types and variables
- String manipulation
- Functions and parameters
- Conditionals and control flow
- Loops and iteration
- Lists and data structures

Each unit contains lessons with multiple section types: Information, Observation, Testing, Prediction, PRIMM, and more.

## Integration

This course is used by the main [thoughtful-coding.github.io](https://github.com/thoughtful-coding/thoughtful-coding.github.io) platform for content. The platform handles:
- Pyodide runtime for browser-based Python execution
- Progress tracking and authentication
- Rendering and navigation
- Test execution and feedback

## Course Goals

1. **Active Learning**: Students predict, test, and experiment rather than passively reading
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Code runs in the browser with instant results
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Each lesson builds on previous concepts
4. **Authentic Practice**: Real Python code, not pseudocode or simplified syntax
