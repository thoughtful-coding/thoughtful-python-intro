            "So far, you've been using loops to repeat the exact same action multiple times. But there's been a secret weapon hiding in plain sight: the loop variable (usually called `i`).\n\nIn `for i in range(5):`, the variable `i` isn't just counting repetitions - it's actually changing each time! It starts at 0, then becomes 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. We can use these changing values to make each repetition slightly different.\n\nThis transforms loops from simple repeaters into dynamic pattern generators. Instead of drawing 5 identical squares, you can draw squares that grow, shrink, change color, or spiral outward!",
